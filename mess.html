<h2>
  Your hand hovers over the controls.
</h2>

<p>
  The machine reacts instantly — lights surge, the room bends,
  the air grows heavier, and a weight settles in your chest.
</p>

<p>
  Something has already changed.
</p>

<p>Where do you go?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="past.html">Step backward — into the past. You have another chance to protect your friend before everything collapses.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="future.html">Step forward — into the future. You meet your older self, who is at peace with herself and her mistakes.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="lost.html">Hesitate — your hand slips across the controls. A bright light pierces the room, pushing you to the floor.</a>
  </li>
</ul>

  Your hand hovers over the controls.
</h2>

<p>
  The machine reacts instantly — lights surge, the room bends,
  the air feels heavier, and a weight settles in your chest.
</p>

<p>
  Something has already changed.

<p>Where do you go?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="past.html">
      Step backward — into the past.
      You have another chance to protect your friend before everything collapses.
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="future.html">
      Step forward — into the future.
      You meet your older self, at peace with who she became.

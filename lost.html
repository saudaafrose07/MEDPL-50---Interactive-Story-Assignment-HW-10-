<h2>
  The machine jolts.
</h2>

<p>
  You didn’t choose a direction —
  and time does not wait for certainty.
  Every bet with time has a consequence.
</p>

<p>
  The room fractures. Seconds stretch and fold in on themselves.
  You feel yourself drifting between moments that no longer belong to you,
  lost and pulled toward someplace unknown.
</p>

<p>
  There is no past to return to.
  No future to arrive at.
</p>

<p>
  Only the space in between —
  where you are left carrying everything you never let go of.
</p>

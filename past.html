<h2>
  You arrive before everything went wrong.
</h2>

<p>
  The room is familiar. Your friend is still here —
  alive, unaware of what is coming.
</p>

<p>
  This time, you don’t hesitate.
  You pull them away before the moment can unfold.
</p>

<p>
  History shifts quietly around you.
  Some things are saved. Other things are lost.
  But your friend is safe, right here in your arms.
</p>

  You wake up inside a dark, musty room, coughing as you rise and check your surroundings.
</h2>

<p>
  In front of you, there’s a strange machine — silent at first, then beckoning you closer.
</p>

<p>
  It hums softly. The lights flicker, and you wonder if this is your chance —
  a chance to change your life, and maybe save your best friend’s.
</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="leave.html">Leave it alone. Don’t touch it.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="mess.html">Reach out. Change something.</a>
  </li>
</ul>

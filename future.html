<h2>
  You arrive somewhere unfamiliar.
</h2>

<p>
  The world is quieter here.
  The edges of it feel worn, like something that has survived a long time.
</p>

<p>
  You see yourself — older, steadier.
  She looks at you with recognition, not surprise.
</p>

<p>
  She tells you that the pain never fully disappears,
  but it becomes something you learn to carry.
  She asks you, “Would your friend be happy to see you like this?”
</p>

<p>
  You leave knowing that healing is not about fixing the past,
  but about allowing time to move forward.
  It’s about forgiving your mistakes,
  celebrating your joys,
  and accepting everything in between.
</p>

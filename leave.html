  You step back and snap out of the trance.
</h2>

<p>
  Playing with time has its consequences.
</p>

<p>
  The machine continues to hum, waiting for a hand that never reaches it.
</p>

<p>
  You realize that healing does not come from rewriting moments,
  but from learning how to live with them.
</p>

<p>
  You leave the room carrying your grief —
  and the strength to face it on your own.
</p>
